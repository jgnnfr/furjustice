                <p>A 25 year old who was identified as transgender named Scarlet Blake, live streamed herself by putting a cat in a blender after being found guilty of killing a man.
                After watching a documentary, a 25 year old named Scarlet Blake, later on decided to live stream and dissect cats. Following this, a woman murdered a man four months after she live streamed dissecting a kitten.

                <p>Animal hoarder ( also known as Noah Syndrome ) is an illness in which an individual keeps a large amount of animals without providing them with basic necessities like food, water, and a sanitary place to live. Animals are frequently kept in small cages, which allows hoarders to acquire an excessive number of animals without basic necessities. As a result, hundreds or even thousands of animals that have been found have starved to death or become ill due to hoarders who operate under the disguise of "rescues" or "shelters."</p>

                <p>Research in psychology and criminology shows that animal abusers tend to repeat their crimes as well as commit similar offenses against members of their own species. This phenomenon is known to law-enforcement and humane professionals as “the link”. For everyone’s safety, it’s vital for law-enforcement officials and communities to treat cases of cruelty to animals seriously and to ensure that animal abusers are appropriately prosecuted and sentenced.
                Children who frequently see other people abusing animals may imitate and harm another animal as well.
                Animals suffer daily from abuse and neglect, often unable to escape. Government, animal welfare, and social service organizations must collaborate to ensure animal safety. Parents should treat animals with kindness, allow them to live in their homes, and avoid exposing children to exploitation-ridden zoos or circuses. Children should also set a good example.
